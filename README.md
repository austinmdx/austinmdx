👋 Hi, I’m [Austin Maddox](https://github.com/austinmdx).
- I ❤️ CODE. Writing code is not my <ins>job</ins>; it is what I do and who I am. I truly have a passion for this stuff.
- I am AWS certified and specialize in JavaScript/php web development(Node.js, React.js, Vue.js, Angular, Laravel, CodeIgniter, etc), running successful development teams, and building/managing cloud infrastructure on AWS.
